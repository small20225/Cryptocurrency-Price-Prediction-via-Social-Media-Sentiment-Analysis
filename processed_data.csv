2024-05-04 00:54:00+08:00,New: @elonmusk emailed me about his plan for AI news on X.   The idea is to use AI to blend breaking news and commentary; building real-time summaries of events. Then you can go deeper via chat on Grok.  Here's the full story! I'll be talking more about this on Big Technology Podcast later today.   Elon Musk’s Plan For AI News  Elon Musk emailed me this week with some  surprising details about his plan to distill and present news on X using  AI. I’d written him after trying Grok — X’s AI chatbot — and noticing  it didn’t link to a Time story it summarized. I wanted to click into the  article and read more; so I reached out.  Musk said better  citations are coming; but shared a deeper vision for the product; which  he wants to build into a real-time synthesizer of news and social media  reaction. Effectively; his plan is to use AI to combine breaking news  and social commentary around big stories; present the compilation live;  and allow you to go deeper via chat.  “As more information becomes  available; the news summary will update to include that information;”  Musk told me. “The goal is simple: to provide maximally accurate and  timely information; citing the most significant sources.”  That  goal won’t be easy to achieve; but the bot might become a novel news  product given its access to the X firehose. “Grok is analyzing sometimes  tens of thousands of X posts to render a news summary;” Musk said.  Already;  Grok is displaying a running list of headlines and incorporating social  reaction into its summaries; including the chatter around the Time  story I sought about Trump’s potential second term. Grok has plenty of room to improve — and will have to figure out issues like citation  and hallucination — but it could be valuable if X gets the execution is  right.  “That's actually what I used to come to Twitter for — news and commentary;” @semaforben; editor-in-chief of Semafor and author of Traffic; told me.  Conversation  on X will make up the core of Grok’s summaries — or; really almost all  of it. Musk said Grok will not look directly at article text; and will  instead rely solely on social posts. “It’s summarizing what people say  on X;” he said. “Definitely needs to do a better job of displaying  relevant posts; including; for example; the TIME post that links to the  article.”  Musk’s approach will make Grok distinct from all AI news  summarizers; and likely more controversial; but there is an opportunity  to satisfy users; publishers; and the platform together. It starts with  solid citation; giving users a way to go deeper into the source  material once their curiosity is piqued.  Josh Miller (@joshm); CEO of The Browser Company;  whose Arc browser is doing AI summarization; told me that platforms;  users; and publishers could all win with aggressive citation. “People  want trust in the data;” he said. “They want to understand where it's  coming from. And more importantly; if we do a good job giving them what  they want; they want more of it. They get more curious. They want to  read deeper.”  Grok  could similarly be an entry point to news stories that people might  otherwise not see; giving them more reason to come back and engage. “I  definitely don't go to Time.com;” Miller said. “So if that was pushed to  me; I would probably go read that Time article. And I wouldn't have  seen it otherwise.”  Igor Babuschkin; a technical staff member  working at Musk’s xAI; said his team is focused on “making Grok  understand the news purely from what is posted on X.” Regarding  citation; he said that “since news is often discussed on X; this can  sometimes lead to Grok making references to existing news outlets. We  are working on improving the citations so that we reliably capture who  the information in the article comes from.”  For publishers; the  value exchange on social media has long been fraught; and this time’s no  different. News companies’ work — like the Time article — drives news  cycles. Summarizing that work without a prominent link back could cut  them off from the economic reward; harming their ability to produce  more. That said; publishers are moving away from subsisting on social  media traffic; which has always been tenuous; even as the fallout’s been  brutal for the industry.  “As an editor in this basically  post-Twitter news environment; I would much rather the platform was  taking my content than taking my journalists’ time;” Semafor’s Smith  said.  Building summaries just from the posts on X — and not  the articles themselves — could give X some distance from the publisher  lawsuits hitting AI companies. Eight newspapers sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement this week; for instance. And the New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft as well.  Courts  tend to include commentary under the provision for fair use; as opposed  to original work; said Danielle Coffey; president and CEO of the  News/Media Alliance; which represents thousands of news publishers. But  using just commentary to summarize the original source; she said; “is a  bit too cute by half though.”  Under Musk; X seemed to initially  deprioritize news — with the temporary removal of headlines from  articles; verification revocations; and some initial algorithm changes —  but Musk’s emails demonstrate that he still views news as a core X  capacity. It’s a potential competitive advantage as competitors like  Meta’s Threads distance themselves from news.  In a perfect world;  original sources and commentary could blend in Grok; drawing details  from insiders; analysis from outsiders; and commentary from the herd.  Leaders at Twitter had long dreamed of such a scenario. And perhaps the  latest breakthroughs in generative AI have made it worth trying once more.

It almost never happened: Bocelli liked the song — which was composed for him — but didn’t think it was fit for the contest.  The 37-year old was half right.   He got 4th place but the song soon turned into a smash hit and is now among the top 20 best-selling singles ever (12m+).   Bocelli — who fully lost his eye sight at the age of 12 — later collaborated with Celine Dion; who remarked “if God would have a singing voice; he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli.”,0.060605,0.06062,66846.0,309261.0,-0.02474430880897579,21.614752587620163,2

2024-04-25 03:19:00+08:00,"We Exposed Censorship By Brazil’s Supreme Court; And Now President Lula Is Persecuting Me    PLUS: Brazil’s Attorney General Is Seeking To Entirely Shut Down X; Formerly Known As Twitter   Thirty years ago this year; I asked Brazil’s current president; who goes by the single name “Lula;” if he would turn his country into Cuba; complete with censorship. He said ""no"" and that he and the Brazilian people loved their freedom too much.    At no point since then did I ever imagine that I would be the victim of Cuba-style censorship and repression at the hands of @LulaOficial . And yet; that is precisely what is happening.    All of this is happening at the same time that Brazil’s Attorney General and Supreme Court are reportedly seeking a way to entirely shut down X; Brazil’s only free speech platform. The Brazilian government recently retaliated against X by cutting off advertising on X. X’s top attorney in Brazil resigned to protect his safety less than two weeks ago.    Yesterday; Brazil’s attorney general; Jorge Messias; urged the Supreme Court to pursue “criminal prosecution” and investigation to “identify and punish the possible culprits.”  My alleged crime was publishing the “Twitter Files - Brazil.” At no point does the Attorney General suggest that either I or my coauthors Eli Vieira and David Ágape lied or presented inaccurate information in the Twitter Files - Brazil.    Rather; the Attorney General office’s six-page memo; released publicly; claims that I released “excerpts of content from confidential judicial decisions” in an “attempt to destabilize the democratic state.”  This is untrue. None of the Twitter Files - Brazil contained “confidential judicial decisions.” The Twitter Files - Brazil were strictly emails between Twitter staff. There is not a single instance where we published “confidential judicial decisions.”    But even if we had; the Brazilian constitution says; “the law may only restrict the publicity of procedural acts when the defense of privacy or social interests so require"" (Article 5; LX).  In this case; it was imperative that we publish the Twitter Files precisely to protect the public’s right to privacy; freedom of speech; and democracy.   What’s more; the attack on me is highly selective. Brazilian news media have; for years; reported on confidential judiciary decisions and have not been subjected to such an outrageous criminal investigation as the one I am under.    Finally; there is no law against attempting to “destabilize the democratic state” through non-violent methods. The law only prohibits violent attacks on democracy. As such; the Attorney General abuses his powers and acts as a lawmaker; usurping Brazil’s Congress.    And just imagine if Brazil criminalized something as vague as “destabilizing the democratic state.” Such a law would allow President Lula to lock up nonviolent protesters; journalists; and his political rivals.  Why is the Attorney General doing this? The first thing to understand is",0.15385,0.15366,1311640.0,2111405.0,0.12364961603540006,62.12166779940371,2

A CNN publicou este segmento embora admitisse que “Ainda não temos provas sobre isso; está sendo investigado”.  Boa sorte em encontrar evidências porque não há nenhuma!  Fui convidado há muitos meses para palestrar no Fórum pela Liberdade no Rio Grande do Sul. Antes de chegar; meus colegas jornalistas brasileiros; David Agape e Eli Viera; me pediram para ver se havia algum arquivo do Twitter no Brasil.  Olhei e descobri que havia. O que descobrimos nos chocou: Alexandre de Moraes e outros funcionários do governo ameaçaram processar criminalmente o advogado do Twitter no Brasil se ele não entregasse informações *privadas* e *pessoais*; incluindo números de telefone das pessoas e suas mensagens diretas pessoais!  Publiquei os Arquivos do Twitter logo após desembarcar em Porto Alegre.  *Ninguém* além de David; Eli e mais um colega meu sabia que eu iria publicar o Twitter Files Brasil.  Depois que ficou claro que muitos brasileiros estavam interessados em falar comigo sobre os Arquivos do Twitter; adiei em uma semana meu retorno aos EUA. Depois que decidi fazer isso; o Diputado Federal Marcel Van Hattem cancelou a sua viagem há muito planejada a Bruxelas.  Conheci Van Hattem em Londres no ano passado; numa conferência; e ele estava no Fórum pela Liberdade; em Porto Alegre. Aceitei com gratidão a oferta de Van Hattem de ser apresentado a diversas pessoas que ele conhecia no Brasil.  É isso. Essa é toda a “coordenação”. Se a CNN tivesse feito o seu trabalho; poderia ter aprendido tudo isto comigo antes de publicar a sua “desinformação”. Na verdade; a CNN me entrevistou há duas noites e contei aos dois repórteres como surgiu o Twitter Files – Brasil. Aparentemente; os repórteres da CNN não conversam entre si.  Aparentemente; a CNN também não fez o dever de casa com Elon Musk. Com Elon; o que você vê é o que você obtém. Ele respondeu publicamente ao Twitter Files Brasil. Não falamos sobre eles nem nos correspondemos sobre eles. Ele ouviu falar deles no mesmo momento em que o mundo ouviu falar deles.  Será realmente tão difícil acreditar que os políticos que foram censurados tenham respondido em X a mais provas das exigências de censura de Moraes? Que idiota.  Estou tentando ser gentil com isso; mas com o segmento abaixo; a CNN não está se comportando como uma mídia de notícias justa e equilibrada.

2024-04-09 21:50:00+08:00,"Read this.  NPR veteran describes the transformation of NPR from a news to an activist organization after Trump's election:  ""During most of my tenure [at NPR]; an open-minded; curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy; but not knee-jerk; activist; or scolding.  In recent years; however; that has changed. Today; those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population...  Like many unfortunate things; the rise of advocacy took off with Donald Trump. As in many newsrooms; his election in 2016 was greeted at NPR with a mixture of disbelief; anger; and despair... But what began as tough; straightforward coverage of a belligerent; truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency [italics mine].  Persistent rumors that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the election became the catnip that drove reporting. At NPR; we hitched our wagon to Trump’s most visible antagonist; Representative Adam Schiff...  The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.  But when the Mueller report found no credible evidence of collusion; NPR’s coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming...  It’s bad to blow a big story.  What’s worse is to pretend it never happened; to move on with no mea culpas; no self-reflection...  [Hunter Biden's] laptop was newsworthy. But the timeless journalistic instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched. During a meeting with colleagues; I listened as one of NPR’s best and most fair-minded journalists said it was good we weren’t following the laptop story because it could help Trump [italics mine]...  Over the course of the pandemic; a number of investigative journalists made compelling; if not conclusive; cases for the lab leak. But at NPR; we weren’t about to swivel or even tiptoe away from the insistence with which we backed the natural origin story...  [Our new director] declared that diversity—on our staff and in our audience—was the overriding mission... Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace. Journalists were required to ask everyone we interviewed their race; gender; and ethnicity (among other questions); and had to enter it in a centralized tracking system [italics mine]. We were given unconscious bias training sessions. A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to 'start talking about race.'  There’s an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they should be framed. It’s frictionless—one story after another about instances of supposed racism; transphobia; signs of the climate apocalypse; Israel doing something bad; and the dire threat of Republican policies. It’s almost like an assembly line.  The mindset prevails in choices about language. In a document called NPR Transgender Coverage Guidance—disseminated by news management—we’re asked to avoid the term biological sex... The mindset animates bizarre stories—on how The Beatles and bird names are racially problematic; and others that are alarmingly divisive; justifying looting; with claims that fears about crime are racist; and suggesting that Asian Americans who oppose affirmative action have been manipulated by white conservatives.  More recently; we have approached the Israel-Hamas war and its spillover onto streets and campuses through the intersectional lens that has jumped from the faculty lounge to newsrooms. Oppressor versus oppressed...  I looked at voter registration for our newsroom. In D.C.; where NPR is headquartered and many of us live; I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.""  thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-n…",0.192165,0.19228,1002029.0,1791229.0,-0.059808612440193455,55.94086518250877,2

2024-04-03 12:26:00+08:00,𝕮𝖔𝖘𝖒𝖎𝖈 𝕮𝖍𝖗𝖔𝖓𝖎𝖈𝖑𝖊𝖘 SpaceX Achieves Ambitious Goal: 12 Falcon 9 Missions in a Single Month  In pursuit of its ambitious objective to conduct 150 missions in 2024; SpaceX has reached a significant milestone by completing 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month. SpaceX closed the month of March with this achievement; which underscores SpaceX’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of space exploration.  SpaceX has been on a trajectory of remarkable growth; surpassing its own records year after year. In 2020 it launched 26 missions; 31 in 2021; and doubled that with 61 missions in 2022. By 2023; the company delivered approximately 80% of all Earth payload mass to orbit with 96 missions completed; outpacing competitors like China and other global players.  The pace of SpaceX’s launches has been accelerating steadily; with the company averaging one launch every four days throughout 2023. This rapid cadence reflects SpaceX’s dedication to innovation & efficiency in space travel.  SpaceX has already completed 32 missions in 2024. The recent accomplishment in March; where SpaceX completed 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month; demonstrates the company’s ability to meet & exceed its ambitious goals with a launch rate of one every 2.8 days. “Falcon 9 successfully launched our 11th and 12th missions of the month from Florida earlier today;” announced the company on March 31. The missions deployed Eutelsat 36D satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit from NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad-39A. And approximately “3.5 hours later; Falcon 9 launched 23 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit from pad 40; completing our 260th reflight of an orbital class rocket on the seven-year anniversary of first achieving this feat;” shared the company.  Key to SpaceX’s success is the reusability of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket; which enables the company to significantly increase its launch pace while reducing costs. SpaceX has reused multiple boosters in its Falcon 9 fleet 19 times; & engineers are working to qualify Falcon 9 for up to 40 reflights each.  As of now; SpaceX has performed a total of 327 missions; landed orbital-class rockets 291 times; and reused previously-flown Falcon 9 boosters in its fleet 261 times. With each milestone achieved; SpaceX reaffirms its position at the forefront of space exploration; inspiring admiration for its groundbreaking achievements. As the company continues to push boundaries and reach new heights; the future of space exploration looks brighter than ever before.  ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───  Author @JaneidyEve  Read more at Cosmic Chronicles: cosmicchroniclesnews.com/202…   Thanks for reading!

2024-03-23 09:58:00+08:00,Under the hood update: Introducing Topic Models; which improve Community Notes’ ability to identify notes that are helpful to people from different points of view.  Community Notes shows notes that are found helpful by people who’ve disagreed in their past ratings. Now; it will factor in both whether raters have disagreed in general as well as on the specific topic of the note. This strengthens the algorithm’s ability to find notes that bridge across topics. We’re initially trialing a small set of Topic Models and will monitor their effectiveness at identifying broadly helpful notes.  As always; code and details are open-source in GitHub; and your feedback helps drive improvements like this one: github.com/twitter/community…,0.16177999999999998,0.16199,1733791.0,4989154.0,-0.1296376319525994,34.751202308046615,2

This is a major reason why the Biden administration is ushering in record levels of illegals and doing so few deportations.,0.16964,0.16953,267241.0,518550.0,0.06488527104348892,51.53620673030566,2
